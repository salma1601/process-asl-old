What is procasl: preprocessing and quantification of ASL
======================================================

.. topic:: **Why use aslip?**

    Procasl gives standard basic preprocessing to ASL data.

    Procasl builds many relevant **pipelines** for processing ASL data,
    :ref:`single subject pipeline <single_subject>`,
    :ref:`second level pipeline <second_level>`.

    Procasl can be used on :ref:`pulsed ASL <pulsed_asl_example.py>`,
    :ref:`pseudo-continuous ASL <pc_asl>`, or 
    :ref:`continuous ASL <continuous_asl.py>` data.


What is ASL?
------------
Tagging magnetization sequentially to capture the flowwing of the arterial blood.
Many modalities and many sequences exist, and ASL techniques is an active research field.

Why ASL?
--------
To quantify the CBF, a fundamental physiological quantity, closely related to brain function.
