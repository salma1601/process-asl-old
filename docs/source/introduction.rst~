What is procasl: preprocessing and quantification of ASL
========================================================

.. topic:: **Why use procasl?**

    Procasl allows to perform standard preprocessing of ASL data.

    Procasl builds relevant **pipelines** for processing ASL data(
    :ref:`single subject pipeline <single_subject>`,
    :ref:`second level pipeline <second_level>`).

    Procasl can be used on :ref:`pulsed ASL <pulsed_asl_example.py>`,
    :ref:`pseudo-continuous ASL <pc_asl>`, or 
    :ref:`continuous ASL <continuous_asl.py>` data.


ASL: labeling arterial blood water magnetically before imaging
--------------------------------------------------------------
Magnetization is tagged sequentially to capture the flowing of the arterial blood.
Many modalities and many sequences exist, and ASL techniques is an active research field.

ASL allows weighting of the MRI signal by cerebral blood flow
-------------------------------------------------------------
The cerebral blood flow (CBF) is a fundamental physiological quantity, closely related to brain function.

Installation
============
**Downloading:** Run the shell command::

    git clone https://github.com/salma1601/process-asl


**Installing:** In the ``process-asl`` directory created by the previous step, run
(again, as a shell command)::

    python setup.py install --user

**Testing the installation:** To check whether everything is set up correctly, open IPython and type
in the following line::

    In [1]: import procasl

If no error occurs, you have installed procasl correctly.
